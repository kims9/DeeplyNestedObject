My First Boyfriend

I would like to represent this relationship because of its impact on my life and the
complicated narraetive that can arise out of this project.

Description of him:
-21, younger than me
-soft-hearted
-uncaring external visage, acts completely differently with me
-humorous
-difficulty with communication
-anxious and depressed
-takes xanax when upset
-lives in TN with parents
-works as pharmacy tech at cvs
-takes classes online at the nearest college (2 hrs away)
-always gaming if home
-doesn't eat much
-doesn't sleep much at night, naps during the day

We never really had a "honeymoon period," there wasn't really any courting and I had to
constantly have conversations with him. He did become a better boyfriend but eventually I
found out that he had been speaking to his ex during our relationship. But we didn't 
stop talking and only got closer and more dependent on each other which created a toxic
cycle.
